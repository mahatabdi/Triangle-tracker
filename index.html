    <p>Triangles are one of the most fundamental geometric shapes and have a variety of often studied properties relating to their:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Interior angles (angles on the inside) sum up to 180Â° more</li>
      <li>Triangle Theorem : This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any 2 sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.<li>
      <li>Relationship between measurement of the sides and angles in a Triangle: The largest interior angle and side are opposite each other. The same rule applies to the smallest sized angle and side and the middle sized angle and side.</li>
